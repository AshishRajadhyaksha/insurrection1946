        <p>Seven days passed. Nothing happened. The CO did not even bother to heed his brother officer's advice. He deferred the hearing till Saturday, the normal day for such work.</p>

         <p>On February 16, the fourteen ratings were called to the office of the CO. He was not in a mood to listen to them. He simply warned them against making false complaints and gave them twenty four hours to think it over, after which they could submit their complaints in writing.</p>

       <p> Food was bad again. The dal was worse than the previous day's. It had been badly cooked, there was no salt in it, it had not even been boiled properly. Everyone walked out of the mess in silent protest.</p>

        <p> At 8:30 a.m. the daily morning inspection for divisions (parade) was piped. But not a soul, except a few Chief Petty Officers and Petty Officers turned up on parade. At the Remote Control Office, the most important branch of the RIN for its day-to-day administration, the ratings came in for their usual morning class. Then they heard of the strike of the CCO ratings. They too walked out and there was no one on parade at 9:30 a.m.</p>

        <p>By the evening the news of the strike in HMIS Talwar had spread all over India. The AIR news bulletins had broadcast the story. All the ships in Bombay harbour and the shore establishments had also heard that their comrades in the Talwar were fighting for their legitimate rights. There was excitement everywhere. At Castle Barracks, at Fort Barracks and other shore establishments the ratings gathered in small groups and discussed the situation; it was something new, something unheard of. Yes, there had been strikes before but this seemed different, this seemed to be the beginning of a real big battle. The humiliation, the discrimination, the suffering must be put an end to for all time. The people of the country would help them. They would be free. Something had to be done to support the Talwar ratings. But what?</p>

        <p>Fort Barracks. As usual, at 5:30 am the bugle sounded but not a soul stirred. Everyone inside the huge buildings heard it, but today these 350 souls were determined to defy the authorities. It was the beginning of their battle to avenge all insults. After some time the ratings got up. Already some of them were busy discussing their plans for the day. In small groups they argued. Others ran about looking for the morning papers. ‘What do the papers say? Has the strike spread everywhere? What is the news from the Talwar?’ With these questions they crowded the papers, reading the headlines, from behind one another’s shoulders. </p>

        <p>At 6.30 the bugle sounded again. Normally this was the time for the ratings to fall-in on the quarter-deck for ‘cleanship’ duty. But today the ratings laughed aloud. Nobody touched the brooms. They did not bother to make their beds. No. They were too busy discussing what they should do. Arguments. Heated discussions. Should they go on hunger strike? Why not take food outside? Words, words, words poured out in an unceasing stream. </p>

        <p>As the speaker continued a rating brought a plate of dal and gave it to the speaker. He paused to look at it and continued: "You have seen one of our brothers bringing in the dal that has been prepared for our breakfast. It's just what we have been eating ever since we joined the service-foul- smelling, half-cooked and full of stones and husks. Now we must put an end to this. Now is the time to follow our brothers in the Talwar and refuse to take this food." The ratings cheered loudly. "Now, at this very moment, let us declare to the authorities that we too are going on hunger-strike. After this meeting let us form a procession and go to the Talwar to tell them that we too have joined the battle." The meeting broke up. "To the Talwar," they shouted as they went round the barracks, getting everyone together.</p>

        <p>They reached the Talwar at about 11:45 a.m.: The Talwar had become a very busy place. Ratings were pouring in from everywhere. As they entered they heard someone speaking through a loudspeaker. ''All ratings are requested to march straight to the parade ground. All civilians are asked to remain calm and wait outside. They must not try to come inside." The civilians obeyed. The ratings marched in. It was one mass of humanity.</p>

         <p> At about 12:30 p.m. a meeting was called. All gathered round. One of the leaders of the Talwar Strike Committee spoke. He narrated all the events that had led up to the strike and the ratings listened quietly...These are the demands we propose to place before the authorities today: 1. Release all political prisoners including those of the INA; 2. Take action against Commander King, CO of the Talwar, for using insulting language against the ratings; 3. Speedy demobilisation and provision for resettlement in peace-time employment; 4. Same scale of pay, allowances, etc. as those of RN ratings; 5. Access to NAAFI canteens; 6. Better food; 7. No return of clothing kit at the time of release; and 8. Withdrawal of Indian troops from Indonesia.".</p>

        <p> The Akbar had a tradition of ‘trouble’. It was probably the worst administered establishment in the whole of the RIN. Corruption of various kinds seemed to flourish there. Only ads recently as in 1944 the Hindu and Muslim ratings together had struck work because the Muslim ratings were not given enough time to say their prayers. As a result, some 200 had been dismissed. But the spirit of revolt could not be crushed. It was only on the 19th that the news of the strike reached the Akbar. For about two hours there was wild excitement all over the establishment. Work virtually stopped. At about 12:30 p.m. the authorities decided to step in. A general parade was called. </p>

        <p>At about two in the afternoon some more ratings arrived at the Talwar. These new arrivals created somewhat of a sensation. Within a few minutes a procession was planned and once more, with Congress, League and Red flags, the ratings marched out of the Talwar. This time the procession was orderly arid disciplined... Going along the Colaba Causeway, they came to Flora Fountain, the centre of Bombay's business quarter, and returned to the Talwar along Back Bay.</p>

         <p>The excitement of  the first day had worn a bit thin but there was an air of uncertainty everywhere. The Talwar was the hub of all activity and from every establishment and ship they began to concentrate there. Fort Barracks. The men got up early as usual. Today there were no bugles to wake them. It was their own day. They were themselves in command. Once again the morning started with arguments and discussions. The problem was food. Hunger strike was all right, but how were they going to fight? Would they not become weak from starvation? But eating food in their own mess was a difficult decision to take but then, they had no other alternative. Eating outside was an expensive business. Their pay was so low that they could not afford it. The senior ratings were so few that they could not undertake to bear the expenses of the others. So it was finally decided that they would cook food and eat it in their own mess. But would the cooks agree to cook the food? That was another problem. What about the strike? The cooks too were on strike. But they were persuaded. After all they were going to feed their comrades and keep them fighting fit. Moreover, quite a number of the ratings volunteered to help them and they all set to work. Breakfast over, they all dressed up in full uniform to go to the Talwar. In real naval style they marched out of their barracks, the three flags at the head. And they marched as if they were on ceremonial 'parade-the only difference was the flags at the head and the slogans that they shouted.</p>

         <p>Very soon news began to pour in from different establishments of the arrival of military guards. At 3: 30 Maratha guards had already surrounded Castle Barracks. The men were cut off from the outside world. They were virtually prisoners. It was the same everywhere...Castle Barracks. The sight of the armed guards made the ratings furious. The offensive must be fought back. Why not break open the armoury and start fighting now? It was with great difficulty that the leading ratings persuaded the others to wait for instructions from the NCSC. After all they were fighting a joint battle. Sporadic actions would only help the enemy. Whatever they did they had to do it together....By this time Maratha guards had been posted at both the gates of the establishment. The ratings were angry but some of them spoke to the guards and found them quite sympathetic. They discovered more. The Marathas had not been told that they were being brought out to fight against their brothers in revolt. They had been told that a Hindu-Muslim conflict had broken out and that they were required to suppress the trouble. But now they were put wise and said that not one of them was going to fight against his own brothers.</p>

       <p>HMIS Gondwana. The ratings from outside had come back with the news of the latest developments. This gave rise to various discussions. Once more the battle of arguments and counter-arguments started. Unused to political struggles of any sort, they began to discuss the fundamentals. Violence versus non-violence; armed resistance versus peaceful protest. Fight back the enemy: if you do not get him he will get you. This was the lesson that they had learned during the six years of war. It had stood them in good stead all these days. But now it all seemed different. But was it really so different? Were not the British the ‘enemy'? Were they not gathering their forces? How could they keep quiet? lf they did not hit back now, they themselves would be slaughtered. After all this was war. And so they argued for hours. On the practice of non- violence they differed, but on one point they agreed. There could be no ignoble surrender. If the British attacked they would have to be fought back with arms. To pacify the protagonists of non-violence it was agreed that before taking to arms a warning would be given to the enemy asking him to clear out. Once this was decided, they began to work with clockwork efficiency. A list of arms and ammunition was prepared. The officers had already abandoned the ship and everything was in the hands of the ratings. The weapons were not many, but sufficient to carry on for some time. They had 4 inch guns, medium machine-guns, rifles, revolvers, grenades and depth-charges. All the weapons and ammunition were ready for use as they had been recently prepared for training purposes. An emergency programme was next chalked out. The tasks were allotted, orders were given and battle positions chosen. A watch was appointed for the night with orders to keep a look-out for ship movements during the night.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile in the FOB's bungalow, the negotiations continued. One of the ratings demanded: "The military guards must immediately be removed otherwise we shall not be able to check the anger of the ratings. We refuse to be held responsible for the consequences." But Godfrey refused to remove the guards. He knew that he had won the first round. The ratings had taken his first offensive lying down. They had not resisted. Now he could break them. "No," he said, "I cannot remove the guards. It is up to GHQ to remove them. I cannot recommend it now. Of course, if you give me an undertaking to surrender and go back to work unconditionally we might remove the military guards." For a long time they argued but Godfrey and Rattray were firm.</p>

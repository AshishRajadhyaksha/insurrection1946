        <p>Seven days passed. Nothing happened. The CO did not even bother to heed his brother officer's advice. He deferred the hearing till Saturday, the normal day for such work.</p>

         <p>On February 16, the fourteen ratings were called to the office of the CO. He was not in a mood to listen to them. He simply warned them against making false complaints and gave them twenty four hours to think it over, after which they could submit their complaints in writing.</p>

        <p> At 8:30 a.m. the daily morning inspection for divisions (parade) was piped. But not a soul, except a few Chief Petty Officers and Petty Officers turned up on parade. At the Remote Control Office, the most important branch of the RIN for its day-to-day administration, the ratings came in for their usual morning class. Then they heard of the strike of the CCO ratings. They too walked out and there was no one on parade at 9:30 a.m.</p>

        <p> "By the evening the news of the strike in HMIS Talwar had spread all over India. The AIR news bulletins had broadcast the story. All the ships in Bombay harbour and the shore establishments had also heard that their comrades in the Talwar were fighting for their legitimate rights. There was excitement everywhere. At Castle Barracks, at Fort Barracks and other shore establishments the ratings gathered in small groups and discussed the situation; it was something new, something unheard of. Yes, there had been strikes before but this seemed different, this seemed to be the beginning of a real big battle. The humiliation, the discrimination, the suffering must be put an end to for all time. The people of the country would help them. They would be free. Something had to be done to support the Talwar ratings. But what?
Secret meetings. Conferences of leading ratings. Long discussions. Arguments and counter-arguments. That was what it was like the whole night. Nobody could sleep. Tomorrow they too would join the battle. They too would come out on strike. They too would refuse to bear the insults and sufferings.
A similar situation developed in the ships that night. There were some sixty naval ships in Bombay harbour. As the ratings went back from 'liberty' ashore they took back with them the news of the strike at the Talwar.

        <h3>19-02-1946; 0630</h3>
        <p>At 6.30 the bugle sounded again. Normally this was the time for the ratings to fall-in on the quarter-deck for ‘cleanship’ duty. But today the ratings laughed aloud. Nobody touched the brooms. They did not bother to make their beds. No. They were too busy discussing what they should do. Arguments. Heated discussions. Should they go on hunger strike? Why not take food outside? Words, words, words poured out in an unceasing stream. </p>

        <h3>08-02-1946; 0915</h3>
       <p> On February 8, an incident occurred which caused great excitement. The first parade for the Central Communications Office (CCO) ratings was at 9:15 a.m. While they were busy dressing in their barracks, the ·CO suddenly walked in and shouted: "Get up, you sons of coolies; you sons of Indian bitches." In surprise the boys turned round. The officer kept on shouting. Unmentionable filth poured out of his mouth. The CO departed, as he had come, in a storm of rage. It is probably true that the boys had failed to come to attention and salute him as he had entered the room. But then they were too busy getting ready for their parade. They decided not to bear these insults quietly any longer. But what were they to do? They could not complain collectively - according to regulations in the Navy they were not permitted to put up joint "requests". So the following morning fourteen ratings individually put in formal complaints against Commander King’s language. The complaints were heard by Lt. Commander Snow, Executive Officer, and referred to the CO on February 10. This officer sensed the deep discontent of the men and sent a personal and confidential letter to Commander King asking him to deal with the matter quickly and tactfully. Meanwhile, Admiral Godfrey, sitting in Karachi, has had enough.</p>

        <p>Seven days passed. Nothing happened. The CO did not even bother to heed his brother officer's advice. He deferred the hearing till Saturday, the normal day for such work.</p>

         <p>On February 16, the fourteen ratings were called to the office of the CO. He was not in a mood to listen to them. He simply warned them against making false complaints and gave them twenty four hours to think it over, after which they could submit their complaints in writing. "No use putting in this complaint," he said. "If you cannot prove it you will only get into trouble!' This was considered to be a threat by most of the ratings, and there was widespread discontent.</p>

         <p>February 18. Food was bad again. The dal was worse than the previous day's. It had been badly cooked, there was no salt in it, it had not even been boiled properly. Everyone walked out of the mess in silent protest.</p>

         <p>At 8:30 a.m. the daily morning inspection for divisions (parade) was piped. But not a soul, except a few Chief Petty Officers and Petty Officers turned up on parade. At the Remote Control Office, the most important branch of the RIN for its day-to-day administration, the ratings came in for their usual morning class. Then they heard of the strike of the CCO ratings. They too walked out and there was no one on parade at 9:30 a.m.</p>

        <p> "By the evening the news of the strike in HMIS Talwar had spread all over India. The AIR news bulletins had broadcast the story. All the ships in Bombay harbour and the shore establishments had also heard that their comrades in the Talwar were fighting for their legitimate rights. There was excitement everywhere. At Castle Barracks, at Fort Barracks and other shore establishments the ratings gathered in small groups and discussed the situation; it was something new, something unheard of. Yes, there had been strikes before but this seemed different, this seemed to be the beginning of a real big battle. The humiliation, the discrimination, the suffering must be put an end to for all time. The people of the country would help them. They would be free. Something had to be done to support the Talwar ratings. But what?
Secret meetings. Conferences of leading ratings. Long discussions. Arguments and counter-arguments. That was what it was like the whole night. Nobody could sleep. Tomorrow they too would join the battle. They too would come out on strike. They too would refuse to bear the insults and sufferings.
A similar situation developed in the ships that night. There were some sixty naval ships in Bombay harbour. As the ratings went back from 'liberty' ashore they took back with them the news of the strike at the Talwar.

        <p>"Fort Barracks. As usual, at 5:30 am the bugle sounded but not a soul stirred. Everyone inside the huge buildings heard it, but today these 350 souls were determined to defy the authorities. It was the beginning of their battle to avenge all insults. After some time the ratings got up. Already some of them were busy discussing their plans for the day. In small groups they argued. Others ran about looking for the morning papers. ‘What do the papers say? Has the strike spread everywhere? What is the news from the Talwar?’
With these questions they crowded the papers, reading the headlines, from behind one another’s shoulders. The Officer of the Day smelt trouble. He was afraid to go and see what the matter was. He promptly rang up the executive Officer, Lt. Commander Khan, and informed him of ‘indispline at Fort Barracks’. "</p>

        <p>At 6.30 the bugle sounded again. Normally this was the time for the ratings to fall-in on the quarter-deck for ‘cleanship’ duty. But today the ratings laughed aloud. Nobody touched the brooms. They did not bother to make their beds. No. They were too busy discussing what they should do. Arguments. Heated discussions. Should they go on hunger strike? Why not take food outside? Words, words, words poured out in an unceasing stream. </p>

         <p>As the speaker continued a rating brought a plate of dal and gave it to the speaker. He paused to look at it and continued: "You have seen one of our brothers bringing in the dal that has been prepared for our breakfast. It's just what we have been eating ever since we joined the service-foul- smelling, half-cooked and full of stones and husks. Now we must put an end to this. Now is the time to follow our brothers in the Talwar and refuse to take this food." The ratings cheered loudly. "Now, at this very moment, let us declare to the authorities that we too are going on hunger-strike. After this meeting let us form a procession and go to the Talwar to tell them that we too have joined the battle." The meeting broke up. "To the Talwar," they shouted as they went round the barracks, getting everyone together. Within a few minutes every one of the 3,000 ratings had joined the procession. More and more joined the procession. On Hornby Road the ratings requested all to close their shops and support the struggle of the RIN ratings. The Indian shopkeepers promptly closed. Some were frightened, some wanted to join the ·procession, but they all responded promptly to the appeal of the ratings. British shop-owners, however, contemptuously ignored their request. This angered the boys. In fury they rushed to the shop-windows and smashed them, breaking up everything. For a time some of the ratings fell into the grip of racial fury. The burning hatred, born of years of humiliation, now got the better of them. Everything foreign became hateful to them, every symbol of foreign domination had to be attacked. In front of the United States Information Library they hauled down the US flag and set fire to it. A mail van with the royal insignia stood on the roadside. Some of the ratings jumped on top of it, threw out the mail and set it on fire. A few Europeans were attacked and seriously injured.They marched towards the gates shouting slogans. Their young voices rent the air. "Inquilab Zindabad" "Hindu Muslim Ek Ho" echoed and re-echoed. The slogans of the people had at last been taken over by the men in the Forces. Commander Streatfield James, the CO of Castle Barracks, was just entering the establishment. He crept past the threatening crowd that thronged the gates. There was revenge m the eyes of the ratings and terror in his. At the gate the sentries removed their belts and joined the procession as it marched out into the Street. As they reached the main street some ratings ran ahead and bought Congress and League flags. Placing them at the head of the procession they marched on. The people looked on with wonder. Men gathered on the pavements, women looked down from the windows, children stopped playing to stare with amazement. The Navy boys were marching in a procession with the Congress and League flags, shouting slogans."Congress-League Ek Ho!", "Inquilab Zindabad!" Hundreds of civilians spontaneously joined the procession, shouting slogans. The procession made its way towards Fort Barracks. Some of the ratings had commandeered the unit trucks and were driving them at the head of the procession. They too put up the Congress and League flags. "We are working people," someone said, "we must put up the Red Flag as well!" No sooner said than done. All the three flags went up at the head of the procession and on the trucks. Triumphantly in the breeze fluttered the Charka, the Crescent, and the Hammer and Sickle. As they reached Fort Barracks, the ratings poured out from the restaurants and, shouting slogans, greeted their comrades. The processionists asked them to join up. "To the Talwar!" they cried. Hurried consultations were held. The Fort Barracks ratings too decided to go to the Talwar. The meeting after breakfast was postponed. The procession swelled and more flags came together. A few more tracks were picked up at the Fort Barracks. Now they headed for Bori Bunder. On the way a white police sergeant tried to stop the procession. All pounced on him. He was beaten black and blue. His revolver was snatched away. He barely escaped with his life. Se they marched on, with their banners flying and shouting themselves hoarse. All along the road these people lined the streets and gazed with wonder at this grand spectacle of marching men.</p>
